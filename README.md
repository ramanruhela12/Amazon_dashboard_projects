I am pleased to share my latest data analytics project: a comprehensive Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard.

The objective of this project was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence. Leveraging Power BI, I designed a solution to monitor Year-to-Date (YTD) performance and uncover key revenue drivers.
Key Analytical Insights:

Revenue Monitoring: Visualized a total YTD revenue of $2M, providing stakeholders with a clear snapshot of financial health.
     Seasonality Assessment: Identified a critical Q4 trend where sales volume surges significantly post-August, highlighting        the necessity for Q4-specific inventory optimization.
Category Performance: "Men’s Shoes" emerged as the primary revenue anchor, contributing 43.18% to total sales, while                 "Mobile & Accessories" drove the highest volume of customer engagement (Reviews) despite lower revenue margins.
Technical Competencies:
     Data Cleaning & Modeling (Power Query)
     DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for complex calculations

Interactive Dashboard Design & UI
I welcome any feedback from my network regarding the visualization techniques or analytical approach used here.
